      "\n",
      "How can you help? By clicking the link and donating. For every Dollar you donate, the Arbor Day Foundation will plant a tree. Essentially $1 = 1 Tree. Our goal is to pledge $20,000,000 by the end of December 31st 2019. Can we do it? I think we can! #TeamTrees\n",
      "\n",
      "FAQ:\n",
      "How did #TeamTrees get started?\n",
      "#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged Mr. Beast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?\n",
      "We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as being the best. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.\n",
      "\n",
      "Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?\n",
      "Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.\n",

      "Why are trees and other plants green? Seems like a simple question. But the answer is full of surprises. Using a special camera that can pick up light just beyond the visible range, into the near-infrared, you’ll get to see trees like you’ve never seen them before. And these other-worldly images can teach us not only why trees are green on Earth, but what color photosynthetic life on other planets might be.\n",

I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. \n",

I wanted a table that could conserve space, be partially made from scraps I have from other projects, AND have room enough for a miter saw and a table saw. All said and done, the main portion of the table was about 8 feet one inch long, and 35 inches tall. the side table added about another 2 feet to the length.

      "How did #TeamTrees get started?\n",
      "#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.\n",
      "Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?\n",
      "We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as being the best. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  \n",
      "Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?\n",
      "Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org, the YouTube donate button, Arbor Day’s #TeamTrees Facebook fundraiser, or the #TeamTrees tiltify fundraiser are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.\n",
      "Is this donation tax-deductible?\n",
      "Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.\n",
      "What does my donation actually go towards?  \n",
      "For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!\n",
      "Where are the trees are being planted? \n",
      "Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!

      "The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. \n",
      "When will the trees be planted?\n",
      "Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. We treat your donation with the greatest respect, so we’re working with Arbor Day Foundation to ensure high survivability rates for all the trees planted as part of Team Trees. Sure, you could plant trees faster, but you’d be risking the integrity of this vision. \n",
      "What species are going to be planted?\n",
      "The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.\n",
      "Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?\n",
      "It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. \n",
      "I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?\n",
      "No. And we will never sell your data. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation. \n",
      "\n",
      "How do I make my donation with Apple Pay?\n",
      "Apple Pay payments can only be processed through the Safari browser. To use Apple Pay, open Safari on your desktop or mobile browser and select the Apple Pay logo at the top of the Donate widget.\n",
      "How do I get in touch with #TeamTrees?\n",
      "If you have questions about your donation, contact donations@teamtrees.org. For media inquiries, contact press@teamtrees.org. For everything else, email info@teamtrees.org.\n",

You are spot on--most nuclear &quot;waste&quot; is scrap, clothes and tools that have radioactive materials (like powder, for example) on them, etc. This waste usually poses very little threat, but is treated as though it were toxic because of the political and cultural sensitivity to radiation. Used fuel, which is used to sustain the nuclear chain reaction in a reactor, contains multiple isotopes of pretty much every element on the periodic table. Because of this, it is chemically toxic, and the amount of energy (radiation) coming off it due to decay is impressive. <br /><br /><br /><br />However, the amount of used nuclear fuel (and other waste, for that matter) is not only far less per unit energy than coal, but it&#39;s far less per unit energy produced than wind, solar, natural gas, or any other known form of power production. Wind and solar harvest minuscule amounts of energy in the form of electric fields. Coal and natural gas harvest significant amounts of energy from chemical bonds. Nuclear harvests insane amounts of energy from nuclear forces. For example, a solar panel produces a few hundred watts in full sunlight; gasoline has about 13 kWh per kilogram; and low-enriched uranium used in correct reactors has 1080 MWh per kg. That&#39;s over 80,000 times the energy density in nuclear compared to burning fossil fuel, which is why there is so little waste.<br /><br /><br /><br />As for the cooling pool: the used fuel is left in a cooling pool (underwater) while the shorter-lived isotopes decay. As these decay away, the amount of energy coming off the fuel (radiation) drops significantly. Typically, current reactors store this fuel for 10 years, reducing the activity to single digits of what it was when it came out of the reactor core. It&#39;s also not useless--as I said, it contains some of every element on the periodic table. My facility recycles it by pulling out uranium and heavier elements (trans-uranics), all of which can be re-cast into new fuel. Removing these also results in significantly less waste, and that waste is dangerously radioactive for far less time. Overall, most people in nuclear is not concerned about spent fuel waste because we have multiple solutions for it with different economic viability. Burying it is the cheapest option, and so that&#39;s what we&#39;re going for. We have the technical know-how to recycle it and pull out multiple useful elements, isotopes, and even recover unfissioned fuel--it&#39;s just more expensive to do that than throw it away. Just like it&#39;s cheaper to throw away solar panels after 10-20 years than to try to recycle them.\",\n",

The Caledonian Forest is pretty much world famous and, at one time, covered a good chunk of Scotland.<br />I have rescued quite a few &quot;baby trees&quot; and replanted them over the years. They have an odd habit of sprouting between the rails on our local railways. They manage to put down roots into the granite ballast but wouldn&#39;t last long as they start to grow. I&#39;ve moved quite a few to safer locations - not a big deal but, like everything else, if we all did a few.........<br /><br /><br />I hope this initiative reaches its goal.<br />Cheers for now,<br />Dougie.\",\n",

      "I make arcade videos! My passion started with the claw machine and continued to arcade ticket games. I also play games that give prizes like Stacker and Keymaster. The coin pusher is also another favorite - some I play winning money, others I win arcade tickets. On some games I even show how to win. If you love anything about the arcade, subscribe for new videos every week, and let's play!\n",

      "How did #TeamTrees get started?\n",
      "#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.\n",
      "\n",
      "Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?\n",
      "We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as having the best reputation. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?\n",
      "Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is this donation tax-deductible?\n",
      "Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.\n",
      "\n",
      "What does my donation actually go towards?  \n",
      "For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are the trees are being planted? \n",
      "Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be State and National Forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will plant the trees?\n",
      "The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. \n",
      "\n",
      "When will the trees be planted?\n",
      "Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "What species are going to be planted?\n",
      "The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.\n",
      "Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?\n",
      "It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focussed on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?\n",

      "TeamTrees has gone viral with its goal to plant 20 million trees by 2020 — but did you know we lose about 10 billion trees per year?  A recent study from the Crowther Lab, ETH-Zurich and the UN suggests we could eliminate two-thirds of manmade carbon emissions by planting 1.2 trillion new trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the best part? There's room on Earth for that without interfering with urban or farmland environments.  Actually, this is the best part: a global tree-planting program could cost as \"little\" as $300 billion.  That's \"only\"  40% of the net worth of the world’s top ten billionaires.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point is: it's doable, and we can absolutely buy ourselves more time to transition to a carbon neutral economy to avoid the worst-predicted effects of climate change.  The study (linked above and discussed in the video) shows exactly where to plant new trees, and the maps (linked above) give suggestions on what types of trees to plant to fit with natural ecosystems.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We can ABSOLUTELY do this, but it will take all of YouTube moving from the TeamTrees movement to the TrillionTrees movement.  So let's do it!\n",

      "Some facts about #TeamTrees I think you will find useful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where are the trees are being planted? \n",
      "Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica\n",
      "\n",
      "Who will plant the trees?\n",
      "The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. \n",
      "\n",
      "When will the trees be planted?\n",
      "Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. \n",
      "\n",
      "What species are going to be planted?\n",
      "The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?\n",
      "It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. \n",

      "There are 2 types of breathing: chest breathing, and abdominal (or diaphragmatic) breathing. Chest breathing is meant to be used in times of great exertion, like a sprint or an emergency situation. It uses the secondary muscles in our chest to pull our chest (and usually shoulders) upward and outward. Other than during exercise, we may find ourselves using chest breathing when we are stressed out. That’s why many of us hold our stress in our neck and shoulders.\n",

They are two very separate issues. For what it&#39;s worth, Dow is also working to remove plastic waste from the environment in order to recycle it.<br /><br />2) Why are Dow jumping on the back of <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TeamTrees\\\">#TeamTrees</a>?<br />They&#39;re not. This video took about 3 months to make. I was coincidentally already making a video about trees at about the same time <a href=\\\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TeamTrees\\\">#TeamTrees</a> was happening. I asked Dow if they would be happy for me to add that end bit (as they&#39;re paying for the video, they could object to me asking for donations) but they were happy with it.<br /><br />3) But it&#39;s using trees/burning trees/killing trees therefore it&#39;s bad!<br />Growing trees removes carbon from the air. The carbon released when a tree is burned is no more than the carbon that tree has absorbed, so has no net effect on global CO2. The problem is when trees are being cut down and burned at a rate faster than they are being planted and growing. As I mention many times in the video, this wood comes from sustainably managed forests, meaning the overall amount of wood in the forest is constant as new trees are planted to replace those removed. Plus, this project uses byproducts of the wood, so no trees are being cut down that would otherwise not have been cut down.<br /><br />4) What about biodegradable plastic?<br />See point #1. Plus biodegradable plastic has its own serious environmental issues (it&#39;s rarely truly degraded). Recyclable plastic is in my opinion much more important than biodegradable plastic, and this bioplastic is recyclable.<br /><br /><br />5) But Dow make money from plastics therefore they are bad<br />Taking an approach like this will not solve the climate crisis. We should be working with massive companies like this to make massive reductions in their greenhouse gas emissions, and hold them accountable if they don&#39;t. Trying to solve global warming without getting the big companies on board will not work. There will always be someone making money from plastics as long as there are people buying plastics. And there will always be people buying plastics.\",\n",

It's defined as a \"calming, pleasurable feeling often accompanied by a tingling sensation.\" If you've ever zoned out listening to a sound or watching a video and experienced a tingly sensation, then you've experienced ASMR! ASMR videos help people get to sleep. They can also help with anxiety and anxiousness (speaking from personal experience). So, sit back, relax and enjoy these tingle inducing sounds!\n",

      "Tutto è iniziato dalla rete e da lì si è sviluppato fino a raggiungere i media di tutto il mondo; sto parlando di #TeamTrees, la raccolta fondi divenuta virale che ha come obiettivo la reforestazione con 20 milioni di nuovi alberi. Il tema è particolarmente sensibile dopo i terribili incendi che si sono susseguiti questa estate in Amazzonia e le proteste nate in tutto il globo, i cambiamenti climatici in generale toccano la sensibilità di molti e tra questi anche i follower del canale youtube \"MrBeast\".\n",
      "\n",
      "L'idea è partita da li: per festeggiare il raggiungimento di 20 milioni di iscritti sul tubo, Jimmy \"MrBeast\" Donaldson ha chiesto pubblicamente consiglio sul come festeggiare tale traguardo. Da Reddit è così giunto il supporto a chi aveva suggerito di piantare 20 milioni di nuovi alberi, uno per ogni iscritto. Una sfida tosta che lo youtuber ha accettato e studiato bene, fino alla scorsa settimana quando è partito ufficialmente il progetto #TeamTrees. \n",
      "\n",
      "Perchè una simile idea venga effettivamente realizzata non bastano le sole intenzioni, così MrBeast e i suoi amici youtuber hanno chiamato a raccolta l'intera comunità della piattaforma, un tam tam digitale che in pochi giorni ha raggiunto anche alcuni dei personaggi più in vista del panoramama tech internazionale. È così partita la gara a chi dona di più, un dollaro equivale ad un nuovo albero e sul sito ufficiale è stata inserita anche una classifica dei benefattori più generosi. \n",

      "What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n",

People cut them down for raw materials to make everything from toilet paper to million dollar homes, and those that dare to defend them are called “tree huggers”—a moniker that makes it difficult for most people to take their cause seriously.  But the simple truth is that we should all do what can to promote tree conservation, because every animal on the planet depends on them. In this episode of Animal Facts, we’ll focus on the relationship between animals and trees, a mutually beneficial relationship that is vital to the life cycles of both.\n",

I’ll always try my best to identify the original base designer and give them a big shout out but this isn't always possible.

They don’t grow bigger all over, like you do. They only grow in very special areas. We’ll learn about a special kind of tissue in trees called MERISTEM. We’ll also play a game - can you guess the tree, if you see its seed? Watch and find out! \n",

      "hey we've got a really great episode for you but before we get to that I really want to talk to you about the team trees initiative here on YouTube it was started by mr. beast hey mr. beast here today we're gonna buy every item in this store mark Rober if anyone was going to make a revenge pay package and over-engineered the crap out of it it was going to be me it's smarter every day hey it's me Destin welcome back to smarter every day with the goal of raising twenty million dollars to plant 20 million trees before January 1st 2020 everything you need to know is in a link down in the description we do have a really cool episode coming up where we work with a really awesome creator and I can't wait for you to see it but for now let's get on with the show hey it's Joel recently we attended the East Coast RepRap Festival affectionately known as Earth a sound you make when you step on Lego it was a wonderful event and what was really cool is we got to design this this is called a Mike flag and the idea is it offers a branded element to your microphone when doing interviews or when just being on camera we got a lot of feedback about this in fact I posted it I believe it was to Instagram lots of comments people said they really wanted to know how to make it and in fact a lot of people at the East Coast RepRap festival that I was talking to commented on this and said this is great is it 3d printed it looks wonderful it sure does by the way did I mention how much I loved you a 3d printed light flag no you did but you can say that Wow you a 3d printed mic flat rocks so I'm gonna show you in fusion 360 how you can design your own for dual extrusion and then we're gonna talk about ways that you might need to troubleshoot the print so let's get to it right here a 3d printing nerd there you are welcome back first let's discuss why a mic flag or something like this is useful well in designing this I'm gonna show you how to put a logo onto something in 3d space lots of people like having logos on things in fact you may have your own logo and you may want it on a thing here is a way to put a logo on a thing and then 3d printed and what's also great this was designed for dual extrusion and so I'm able to not just print a logo on something I'm able to do it in a different color or material than the thing that's kind of cool doing something like this also gives us a chance to troubleshoot problems along the way which we had a few of them before we get into this though let's design our thing let's go into fusion 360 and spit out a mic flag model to the computer look at this we've got fusion 360 open and I'm gonna show you how to create your own mic you first what we need to do is start off with a sketch and I've got that right here click right here and then I'm gonna go up to create rectangle and Center rectangle and from origin I'm gonna click and drag out and type 69 for each side and then hit enter because our measurements say that the mic cube should be 69 millimeters on either side now hit over offset and click a side of that square there and then bring it in and we'll say three three millimeters easy enough it okay one more time though hit o for offset look here and we're gonna bring it in 1.5 millimeters last what we need to do is put a circle right in the center so we're gonna click and drag out a center circle and type 40 for the diameter and hit enter those are all the sketches we need for this now what we need to do is extrude them upwards we know that we want the mic cube to be 32 millimeters tall so this outer wall hit E for extrude type in 32 and hit enter go back to sketches turn on your sketches because we're not done yet this part of the wall though this needs to be a shelf on the inside that the top part is going to be able to rest on and we want to we'll say a two millimeter top part on the mic cube the thing that goes over the foam so then hit F or extrude with it it's selected and typed with 30 because 32 is the total height 30 is gonna be the height for this and choose join last this part right here this is gonna be the bottom of the my cube so with the top being two millimeters the bottom should be two so we hit eeper extrude with it selected at two and make sure it says join and then hit enter that was easy right but how do we make this top part here this little top part that clicks into place that's it's actually pretty simple go over to bodies and uncheck select this hold down shift and select this one and it e for extrude go ahead and turn the bodies back on and set up a profile plane you're gonna use an offset plane and the offset is going to be you guessed it 30 millimeters that means that this extrusion is gonna start 30 millimeters in the air or essentially right where we have that little shelf so our extrusion distance is gonna be 2 millimeters and if you look the preview looks pretty good that's exactly where we want it but we don't want to join though what we want to do is make that a new body because we want to print that separately so with new body selected hit OK there it is look at that we have our two bodies this is the body of the might cube this is the top of the my cube you can turn off that sketch for now now though what we need to do is put our logo on it it's actually a lot more simple than you would think go ahead and click the side that you want to start on and then go to insert and insert SVG click the folder icon I'm gonna pick my 3d P n the vector logo here and I'm gonna drag it into place obviously you're gonna be using your logo so what you want to do is pick and choose your logo to use and you know you want to size your logo but this is where I'm gonna put mine I'm gonna hit OK and then I'm gonna hit finish sketch so we've got 3d printing nerd right there and these are all vector lines so we can extrude on them so go ahead and select the three and then select all of the letters we're gonna hit E for extrude and you're gonna take that arrow and you're gonna go back into the model in fact you're gonna go minus 3 for the distance because that's how thick your wall is you want to cut out the wall first so make sure your operation is a cut and then hit OK this next step we're going to now extrude 3 millimeters but we're going to tell it it's a new body that's because we want to do dual extrusion and make this multicolor so what I like to do turn off bodies turn on the sketch and then that makes it easier to select everything with everything selected you can turn the bodies back on hit E for extrude and that arrow you're gonna back it in minus 3 again just like before you just want to make sure that operation is set to new body and then you hit OK it's gonna create a bunch of bodies over here in the in the object browser but that's okay because these are all bodies and we'll eventually sign them all out as a stl file now at this point though we need to replicate this across the four sides and that's where a pattern comes into place so go up to create pattern circular pattern yes it's a square we want circular pattern pattern type is going to be features and for objects we're gonna go down here and select this remember this was the extrude that was the cut this is the extrude that was the fill in so we're gonna choose the cut for the axes what we can do let's see let's go and turn off the lid and then we want to choose this blue one right here and for quantity we want 4 so essentially we're taking a flat plane and rotating it four more times and that's gonna give us the cutouts on all the side 4 compute option make sure add just is selected and hit OK usually we'll think a bit but look we have 3d printing nerd cut out on all sides the next step now is to pattern the fill in parts and that's pretty easy to do it's the same process so pattern circular pattern features the objects this time is going to be the extrude where we filled everything in the axis is going to be the blue one or the up axes and the quantity is gonna be 4 make sure add just is selected for compute option and hit OK it worked you can turn off the sketch there and if you rotate around we have now 3d printing nerds on all of them so now you're probably asking yourself well this is great but how do we save this out for dual extrusion this part isn't the easiest part but I think I think this is how you do it and let's give it a try what we need to do is find the number for the bodies of the not the logo so let's see so if you run your mouse over the side walls that aren't a part of the logo it looks like it's highlighting body 36 if I turn that off that's perfect so then the middle part of the D is 32 there's probably an easier way to do this but what I'm gonna do is just go through and select all of them if you know of an easier way to do it please let me know in the comment down below so there we go here's what we have we have all of the non logo bits turned off and we just have the logo sitting out there in space so what you want to do at this point is save off this STL as just the logos so right up here where it says unsaved because we have these selected in a way that makes only these visible what we can do is hit the right mouse button instance and do save as STL our selection is the everything but because we have the sidewalls and then on logo turned off this is all it'll save it as settings here are fine so I'm gonna hit OK and what I'm gonna do is just call these mic cube logos dontist yep just like that so if you have everything selected whatever you have selected you can hit the right mouse button and you can hit the show or hide thing and that will just everything that's shown will be hidden and everything that's hidden will be shown so we have this lid up top we don't want to save that with everything else so here we go this is just the mic cube part we can go up here hit right mouse button save as - STL hit OK and we'll call it how about mic cube outer now the last thing to do so this this up top this lid right here this is just body - we can just right click on the body and set it same as STL and we'll call it mic cube lid STL and that's it that's it right there that's how you create a mic cube in fusion 360 now I have to do is print it out I'm dragging both STL's into idea maker and here they are I do get a notice that they're invalid so what I can do is click each one and then go to repair and hit OK these are both assigned now to a certain extruder so what I want to do is assign the part of the mic cube that's not the logo to the left extruder and under pan now it's the left extruder at the left extruder I'm going to change the color and it's going to be blue so now what I need to do is select this model and say you're on the right extruder and your color is going to be white just like that last I need to hit ctrl a to select them all and now with them all selected I'm gonna hit the right mouse button i'ma hit align not too bad so it's does this aligns the model essentially instead of place them on the build plate it says line them all in the center and they should work out and that's that's how that works out so now pretty cool and that's set for tool extrusions so now all we have to do is print it out and see what happens yeah we've done the tutorial now you're armed with information that shows you how to put a logo onto something and in this case it is a Mike flag I mean look at it so it's really simple because these were the two pieces that we modeled and this foam inside this is literally just foam like go buy something on Amazon unbox it and then take a knife to the foam and just cut out a shape that's similar in size to the inside and then use a knife to cut out a hole similar in size to this a little bit smaller because you want that friction fit then you put this on the inside and then I friction fit this on top and then you have a Mike flag and it just goes on your microphone like a display just like that and now you're ready to interview anyone you want to this is kind of cool but there were some problems along the way and I think this is useful information so let's get into these first well first you're really you're gonna ask me Joel did you use the palette the palette does multi color multi material did you use that I didn't because that was busy on another job you'll get to see that in the future don't worry about it so the first thing I did was load up the flashforge creator three with filament and I gave it a try and I ran into a number of errors I mean I mean look at that that's spectacular look look how look how it kind of it was almost like a layer shift but it's a dual independent extruder so layer shifts aren't really a typical thing on that the flashforge creator did it run did run into some issues I used flash print I used to simplify 3d and a there were a myriad of settings that I had to adjust and I got something honestly that was close like these are these are close this is close but again this is something that's going to be in the public on video in front of people I want this to be as perfect as possible and so stuff like this I expected more from this machine and I'm really sad that the machine didn't perform as expected so all of those prints those will get ground up and turned into filament later next we moved to the Z morph VX it's it's a neat machine with a myriad of tool heads that it can use the one that I chose for this is actually two filament goes in one filament comes out it's like Thunderdome four filament and it's cool because you could do two color because there's two filaments but you can also do a gradient because it's able to mix depending on how fast you feed the filament into the nozzle for this I just want a dual color because I wanted white for my logo and blue for the rest of the mic flag problem was it's just didn't do it good enough so first I started with this I thought this was great it's it doesn't have a bunch of extra stuff on it but the problem is because it's a mixing tool head I needed to purge the white filament more because the high five blue filament from proto pasta has a lot of pigment in it and unfortunately this isn't something that I can show on camera at a show when I'm interviewing someone there weren't a lot of wisps or strings on this it did perform well I tried to purge more but I could never get a usable solution I was using Vox eliezer there slicer and for some reason I couldn't figure out how to properly print this saying it's cool software I just couldn't figure out I'll spend some more time with it if you have tips for Vox eliezer please leave them in the comments but this is what I got it's close but it's not good enough so what I did is I moved over to the Rays 3d pro 2 plus and the reason I thought this was going to give me success is because it's it's not a dual independent extruder but it is dual nozzle which means that I'm not gonna have to worry about clearing out the blue pigment before the white filament comes out like the Z morph VX and well it worked it worked pretty well I used a white wall and I was able to print this but I was still getting some leftover bits in there I feel like I'm SuperDuper close like SuperDuper close so what I did is used a specific setting with an idea maker that says that the nozzle not in use cools down a little bit and what this does is it eliminates any use from the nozzle it's fantastic and I was able to get it printed and that's why we have this this wonderful mic flag right here again everybody got to see it at the eastcoast RepRap festival now you've seen it and hopefully with this tutorial now I've empowered you to make something awesome so go make something awesome and tag me on the Twitter's I'm at joel telling i'd love to see what you make well there we go look at that a useful video I've taught you something cool I hope you go forth and make awesome don't forget to hug each other more I do love you all and as always high-five you \n"
