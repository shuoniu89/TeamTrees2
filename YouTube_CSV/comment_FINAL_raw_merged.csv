Literally everybody in the audience could barely understand him how fast he was talking and how quick his words jumbled together.  I was really upset that night because I wanted to hear him in person because he is very creative and hilarious but it was probably the worst stand up tact I‚Äôve ever been to because of that.  I just hope he stays sober from now on.

This is the second story I&#39;ve checked out because it sounded like awesome stuff, but it turns out too good to be true. He&#39;s hooked on being the best so-called clean rocknroll comic at AA. But one&#39;s best jokes shouldn&#39;t be lies about internationally broadcasted stuff that can easily be verified. That&#39;s not how fictionalisation works. It ruins the jokes afterwards. <br />Artie&#39;s punchlines are well crafted jokes about the sadness of his imploded life, but easily instantly exposed.<br />He didn&#39;t puke right when rosanne mentioned her bathing suit. He just puked during a radio show.<br />And giraldo didn&#39;t call him a &quot;fat f*cking drug addict&quot; and didn&#39;t do the hands thing, so artie wasn&#39;t humoristically betrayed by his druggy friend he just saved and who would die soon afterwards anyway.<br /><br />Funny how that works. One learns in comedy courses to spin one&#39;s actual real life anecdotes into &quot;material&quot;. There&#39;s an unspoken pact between comedians to accept everyone&#39;s is just pretending to share authentic life stories while telling timed fiction. And the pact with the audience is that they don&#39;t question truth but accept it as something entertaining between fiction and nonfiction, in order to get caught up, to identify and to be touched (and escape). But this game of mirrors doesn&#39;t work any more, for me at least, when the material is based on already famously shared moments, that can also easily be traced back. I guess artie&#39;s old school junky jokes outdate the surveilling foreverness of the Internet. Luckily they fit the simplistically dumbed down mass media short attention span of current times."

Recently I was in a k-hole while being at a club where they get you good let, things got surreal, the visuals were there, sound distortions, feeling of being disoriented and glued to the sofa at the same time for hours was interesting. The music that I usually don&#39;t like they play at that bar became enjoyable and I understood it more. Lately it has been sometimes but to me it doesn&#39;t seem addictive as coke, you can get your sleep after a while and best part next day when I wake up I don&#39;t feel any hangover, while alcohol is the worst."

Put some sugar in their mouth and it will counteract the K.  This is a well known trick in the party community and 100% works.  I know from experience.  If they start actually seizing from K, you didn&#39;t get K and should really think about who your getting your shit from.  I honestly don&#39;t think anyone should report on ANY psychedelics they haven&#39;t  had experience with because they are more than just a drug, they can be potential tools in one&#39;s understanding of themselves and the universe around them.  K worked better on my depression than anything I&#39;ve ever tried before and pharma companies don&#39;t like that and I&#39;m sure will have no problem pushing propaganda videos out there.  This isn&#39;t one, I don&#39;t think, my main point is alot of these types of videos are just regurgitation of library books.  Watch some videos on actual experience and enlightenment that may have come with."
