Summary:  The internet challenged Mr. Beast to plant 20 million trees.  That is a really hard thing to do. So we banded together all our YouTube friends and started #teamtrees.  Basically we partnered with Arbor Day and got them to agree that for every $1 we raise, they would plant 1 tree.

TeamTrees FAQ:
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

How did #TeamTrees get started?
#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as having the best reputation. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

Is this donation tax-deductible?
Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.

What does my donation actually go towards?  
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!

Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be State and National Forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.
Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focussed on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 

I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?
No. And we will never sell your data, etc. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation.

A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as having the best reputation. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

Is this donation tax-deductible?
Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.

What does my donation actually go towards?  
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!

Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be State and National Forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.
Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focussed on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 

I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?
No. And we will never sell your data, etc. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation.

Can You Plant Trees with Bullets? • Randomonium #1

We need trees to survive... but countless trees are being destroyed everyday. We've accepted the invitation from Mark Rober and MrBeast to plant as many trees as possible by 2020. That's not much time. So here's the question: how can any one person do the most good for the world's tree population in the shortest amount of time?  We're going to attempt a little ""firepower"" to speed up the tree planting process.

So Mr Beast went and did it - he responded to the challenge from the internet and set up Team Trees in order to raise $20 million by 2020 in order to plant 20 million trees! And it's looking pretty likely that Team Trees is going to hit the fundraising goal...which is sweet! 

I wanted to find out a few things and answer some questions I had like:

Where are Team Trees going to be planting the trees?
How much impact will 20 million trees have on climate change?
How much space will 20 million trees take up?
How is the Arbor Day Foundation going to maximise survival of the trees that are planted?

This video is the answer to those questions. 

Learn more about what Team Trees is and how Mr Beast, Mark Rober and the Arbor Day Foundation once to have an impact on the world!

AMffdVUQgbk,#TeamTrees Hitting 20 Million Trees Planted (2M% Speed Timelapse),250.0,2019-12-25T21:00:14.000Z,24,Entertainment,en,none,"1,314 hour timelapse (54 days) of #TeamTrees hitting 20 million trees planted, from our livestream on October 25 - December 19, 2019. From start to finish, from Day 1 of the fundraiser until TeamTrees hit 20 million trees planted.

TeamTrees is a fundraiser organized by popular YouTubers MrBeast and Mark Rober. Besides planting trees in an environmentally sustainable way, one of the main goals of TeamTrees is to show that we care about the environment on our planet and that we are willing to take action to make need changes. Since it's start many other YouTubers, and even some prominent people outside of YouTube have joined the cause of supporting and promoting TeamTrees.

If you're reading this before January 1, 2020, it's not too late to donate. All funds sent to TeamTrees are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting in forests of high need around the globe. One dollar plants one tree.

Go here to donate and support TeamTrees : https://www.teamtrees.org/

I also show you some of the interesting parts of the day, such as Elon Musk donating 1,000,000 trees, Tobi Lutke donating 1,000,001 trees and the other top 5 donations of TeamTrees in the moments that they happened.

If you like time lapse videos like this one, stay tuned for other ones like this one!

Thanks for watching, and have an awesome day!

#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

All funds sent to TeamTrees are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting in forests of high need around the globe. One dollar plants one tree.

If you can't afford to donate, please spread the word!

- -- --- ---- Lyrics ---- --- -- -


I really dig how surface tension carries water to the stems
Converting carbon dioxide into lovely oxygen
And how they use that photosynthesis
Turning sunlight into food
There’s nothing in this world that puts me in a better mood

- Pre-Chorus:
Is there anything better than a tree?
If you ask me, it ain’t that hard to see

 - Chorus:
How about 20 million? 20 million trees!
Making 20 trillion little baby leaves
And I can’t help but choke up thinking about all the birds and bees
Living in 20 million, 20 million trees
Let's plant 20 Fir and 10 Cedar and a hundred Hickory
And a couple thousand Cottonwoods
Sounds pretty good to me
We’ll get some White Ash, Black Birch
And a million Red Pine
And a thousand Sugar Maple cause 
They’re lookin’ mighty fine
Ten thousand Honey-Locust standing proudly in the sun
And a million extra Oak trees isn’t hurting anyone
A couple hundred thousand Palm trees
Swaying in the ocean breeze
Deciduous, coniferous, and everything in between
Yeah yeah yeah!

Let’s plant 20 million, 20 million trees!


- -- --- ---- End ---- --- -- -




HELLO DDR's (Dedicated Description Readers)!
Ok, so this short video shouldn't have been very hard, right? That's what I thought, but I was wrong. Oh so very wrong... I've been working on this non-stop since 6:00pm yesterday. It's currently 5:22am and I'm exporting the 2nd draft... My back hurts.

I hope this is good. It BETTER be good! And by ""good"" I of course just mean the export. The video itself is freaking WEIRD!! Oh, so much weirder than I expected! I mean, we wrote this song to be funny, I made the video to be funny... How come when they're put together they turn out CREEPY?! Is it just me? I hope it's just me! XD

ANYWAY, this was a really fun video to make regardless! My favorite of this video had to be making the song though! Nate and I wrote and recorded ""20 Million Trees"" in less than 24 hours! It pretty much wrote itself. After we finished, I sent it to Jimmy (MrBeast) and Destin (Smarter Every Day) and the LOVED it! They asked if they could share it with everybody involved in this project, so hopefully, the song will do very well! Here's the FULL song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDJlZphf2sk

Anyway, I know y'all want an easter egg, so here are some outtakes from the video!
Have fuuuuuunnn: https://youtu.be/1cAGJCBqdtE

I just wanted to show my support for this awesome and huge fundraiser. And show that we do care about this planet we live on, and that we can really come together on social media and not just retweet or like things, but actually try to make an impact. 20 million trees isn't going to solve everything, but it will make a HUGE difference both literally and culturally to get the ball rolling in taking our care of the environment seriously. 

So I did what I do (questionably) best! ASMR!!!!! WITH TREES! Enjoy this extra video :)

But it is possible to make plastic from wood, reducing the need for fossil fuels and reducing the impact on global warming. This video is funded by Dow.

http://teamtrees.org/

CORRECTION: When the cellulose is being extracted from the wood to make paper, both the lignin and the pitch are left behind. But it's the pitch (not the lignin) that goes into the crude tall oil. Sorry I got this wrong in the video (and I wish the YouTube annotations feature was still a thing).

Lyrics:
Have you heard of the hashtag #TeamTrees?
It's this thing that was started by a YouTuber named Mr. Beast
But he's far from alone
No, there's a whole community
And I'm happy to say that Team Trees also includes me

The goal is to raise 20 million dollars to plant 20 million árboles 
That means trees in Spanish 
Just wanted to change it up a little
I felt like I had already said the word ""trees"" too many times in this song

The ad revenue from this video will be donated
So watch it again, watch it again, watch it again
It's not complicated 

Call me a tree hugger
That don't sound bad to me
I just gotta do something to reduce my climate change anxiety

We know this won't solve everything, but it's a place to start
Here's your opportunity to be a little part
Go to teamtrees.org that's team trees dot o-r-g
For every dollar that you give they're gonna plant a tree

Let's make the world a greener place
For us, for you and me

About Arcade Matt:

I make arcade videos! My passion started with the claw machine and continued to arcade ticket games. I also play games that give prizes like Stacker and Keymaster. The coin pusher is also another favorite - some I play winning money, others I win arcade tickets. On some games I even show how to win. If you love anything about the arcade, subscribe for new videos every week, and let's play!

Go to http://www.teamtrees.org
Today we are coming to you with a fun video trying to help out with one of the biggest YouTube collaborations in history!  Thousands of creators are coming together to help MrBeast plan 20 million Trees!  With the help of the Arbor Day Foundation, for every $1 donated, 1 tree will be planted!

#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

As long as there are trees being planted to replenish what we cut down! Donate to #TeamTrees HERE: https://teamtrees.org/ we are getting close to our goal of 20,000,000 trees donated by 2020! Team Trees and the Arbor Day Foundation will make sure 20,000,000 million trees are planted and cared for around the world by 2022. 

In this video Ill be showing how I built a woodworking table for my shop. I wanted a table that could conserve space, be partially made from scraps I have from other projects, AND have room enough for a miter saw and a table saw. All said and done, the main portion of the table was about 8 feet one inch long, and 35 inches tall. the side table added about another 2 feet to the length. The measurements all depend on the size of your tools.

What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

Is it fun to work with? NO!

Why are trees and other plants green? Seems like a simple question. But the answer is full of surprises. Using a special camera that can pick up light just beyond the visible range, into the near-infrared, you’ll get to see trees like you’ve never seen them before. And these other-worldly images can teach us not only why trees are green on Earth, but what color photosynthetic life on other planets might be.

RqVB6cHAfFM,Mr. Beat Plants a Tree for Mr. Beast #teamtrees,237.0,2019-10-27T12:08:20.000Z,27,Education,en,none,"Mr. Beast asked YouTubers to plant trees. Since Mr. Beast is Mr. Beat's son (not really), he decided to plant a tree. #teamtrees #fundraiser

Visit https://teamtrees.org/

How did #TeamTrees get started?
#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.
Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as being the best. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  
Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org, the YouTube donate button, Arbor Day’s #TeamTrees Facebook fundraiser, or the #TeamTrees tiltify fundraiser are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.
Is this donation tax-deductible?
Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.
What does my donation actually go towards?  
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!
Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica! Click here to see a list of the Arbor Day Foundation’s previous work around the globe. 


Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 
When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. We treat your donation with the greatest respect, so we’re working with Arbor Day Foundation to ensure high survivability rates for all the trees planted as part of Team Trees. Sure, you could plant trees faster, but you’d be risking the integrity of this vision. 
What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.
Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 
I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?
No. And we will never sell your data. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation. 

How do I make my donation with Apple Pay?
Apple Pay payments can only be processed through the Safari browser. To use Apple Pay, open Safari on your desktop or mobile browser and select the Apple Pay logo at the top of the Donate widget.
How do I get in touch with #TeamTrees?

How do you decide what the biggest tree in the world is? Tallest? Heaviest? The Great Banyan in the Acharya Jagdish Chandra Bose Botanical Gardens in Kolkata, India, has the world's largest canopy by area, making it a certified W I D E   B O I.

Team Trees is a mass YouTube creator collaboration with the intention of raising money and planting 20 million trees by 2020. It's spearheaded by channels like Mr Beast, Mark Rober, Minute Earth, Smarter Every Day and is generating funds for the Arbor Day Foundation.

The Great Banyan has well over 3000 prop trunks, which are basically roots. The security guard, who had a gun about as old as the tree, told me that the tree is now permanently closed because jackasses kept vandalising it by carving things into the trunks. Humans, I swear. If I was a tree I'd rightfully consider us a bunch of pricks. Planting 20 million is the LEAST we can do!

Incidentally, the Botanical Gardens are named after JC Bose, one of my heroes. Find out more about him by listening to a podcast I appeared on here: https://youtu.be/NTH834yoFEM

Many thanks to the #teamtrees organisers, who put in all the work behind the scenes. I'm grateful to be able to contribute.

Deshalb wurde die TeamTrees-Spendenseite eingerichtet: Pro Dollar einen Baum. Elon Musk hat gerade 1 Million gespendet. Ob das jetzt die neue Ice Bucket Challenge wird und wie man überhaupt 20 Millionen Bäume pflanzt, jetzt!

And thanks to the immense archive of data, we can see how the world has changed over time more clearly than ever.

$1 = 1 Tree

We've joined forces with MrBeast, Mark Rober and the Arbor Day Foundation to bring you this special music video in an effort to try to plant 20 million trees by the end of 2022. 

How can you help? By clicking the link and donating. For every Dollar you donate, the Arbor Day Foundation will plant a tree. Essentially $1 = 1 Tree. Our goal is to pledge $20,000,000 by the end of December 31st 2019. Can we do it? I think we can! #TeamTrees

FAQ:
How did #TeamTrees get started?
#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged Mr. Beast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as being the best. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

What is #ASMR? ASMR stands for autonomous sensory meridian response. It's defined as a ""calming, pleasurable feeling often accompanied by a tingling sensation."" If you've ever zoned out listening to a sound or watching a video and experienced a tingly sensation, then you've experienced ASMR! ASMR videos help people get to sleep. They can also help with anxiety and anxiousness (speaking from personal experience). So, sit back, relax and enjoy these tingle inducing sounds!","""bob ross asmr"",""bob ross"",""asmr painting"",""whispering asmr"",""asmr for sleep"",""team trees asmr"",""team trees"",""mr beast"",""mr beast team trees"",""asmr"",""the joy of painting"",""for sleep"",""to relax"",""oddly satisfying"",""water color asmr"",""painting trees in watercolor"",""scratching"",""tapping"",""brushing"",""slow"",""trigger"",""triggers"",""gentle""",81,21852,772,24,https://www.youtube.com/embed/_zT8aOvNLaY?autoplay=0,HeatheredEffect ASMR,166000,professional,21852,81,397.3090909090909,1.4727272727272727,0.16614064180856616,3.422871001693131,theme_creation_performance,Creation,4,3.6666666666666665,4,n,y,y,n,n,2

The situation is just perfect. So today we are going to sit down with The Spiffing Brit and watch as he starts Planting 20 MILLION TREES IN PRISON ARCHITECT. Honestly we are taking a prison building simulator and just turning it into a sandbox forestry tycoon instead.

The final quantity will be added up on the 1st of December and I will pledge a donation on behalf of the communi-tea. Please remember this is not my donation this is my donation on behalf of you!! 

If you are feeling super generous feel free to also do a pledge here: https://teamtrees.org/

---------------------------------------------------------
TeamTrees has gone viral with its goal to plant 20 million trees by 2020 — but did you know we lose about 10 billion trees per year?  A recent study from the Crowther Lab, ETH-Zurich and the UN suggests we could eliminate two-thirds of manmade carbon emissions by planting 1.2 trillion new trees.

And the best part? There's room on Earth for that without interfering with urban or farmland environments.  Actually, this is the best part: a global tree-planting program could cost as ""little"" as $300 billion.  That's ""only""  40% of the net worth of the world’s top ten billionaires.

The point is: it's doable, and we can absolutely buy ourselves more time to transition to a carbon neutral economy to avoid the worst-predicted effects of climate change.  The study (linked above and discussed in the video) shows exactly where to plant new trees, and the maps (linked above) give suggestions on what types of trees to plant to fit with natural ecosystems.  

We can ABSOLUTELY do this, but it will take all of YouTube moving from the TeamTrees movement to the TrillionTrees movement.  So let's do it!

#TeamTrees is a project that was started by Mr.Beast and it aims to plant 20 million trees around the globe.
It started when Mr.Beast asked his fans what should he do when he reaches 20 million subscribers and his fans replied that he should plant 20 million trees.
To help Mr.Beast with that challenge, he partnered with Arbor Day Foundation, a non-pofit tree planting organisation, where everyone can donate one dollar for each tree to be planted.

The christmas trees planted today are 2-0 greenhouse plugs including 100/each of Norway Spruce, Concolor Fir, and Canaan Fir trees.

With this planting, we're trying several different tactics in hopes that we'll have better survival rates with this batch of tree seedlings: 
1) We're using a subsoiler to dig deeper into the soil and to break up the hard clay that's just under the top soil. 
2) The tree seedlings are dipped in planting gel which helps with moisture retention and also give nutrients to helps the roots grow
3) Fertilizer tablets are put in the ground near the seedling with hopes they'll feed the trees for the next 18-24 months.
4) For this planting, we're trying greenhouse plugs, which retain their soil from the greenhouse. We hope this helps with higher survival rates. Time will tell! 

We're also impressed and pleased with the #teamtrees effort in response to MrBeast reaching 20 million subscribers. We encourage you to go to https://teamtrees.org/ and consider donating to help plant 20 million trees all over the world by 2020. 

Mark Rober explains what the effort is all about in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7nJBFjKqAY

I used two small trees to build an electric guitar / synth controller. Yes it's real!  I'm reading the analog-ins from an Arduino which is connected to the trees and acting as a potential divider. That data is transferred to MIDI notes via a MIDI shield and the Arduino MIDI library. I'm using Ableton Live to push those notes into a scale and time.

TeamTrees FAQ:
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

How did #TeamTrees get started?
#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with several people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as having the best reputation. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

Is this donation tax-deductible?
Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax-deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.

What does my donation actually go towards?  
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!

Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be State and National Forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.
Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focussed on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 

I’m not signing up for junk mail, am I?
No. And we will never sell your data, etc. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation.

Why do we like trees so much? Sheryl explores this idea as part of the #TeamTrees campaign along with other YouTube creators to support the Arbor Day Foundation and their goal of planting 20,000 trees before the year 2020. We like trees because of the things we get from them (called ""ecosystem services"") and also because of the emotional connections we form with them. Sheryl also explores why we like the idea of tree planting campaigns like #TeamTrees.

Professor Silly Bob is thinking about how brilliant it must be to be a tree!  But why?  It's because he’s a scientist!  He knows that trees are scientific marvels and are incredibly useful to life on Earth.   Silly Bob tells his bodyless companion Flo about how people and animals need food and water, a place to live and air to breathe and how trees help with all of these things.  

He explains that a tree is a type of plant with a thick wooden trunk that extends out into branches, usually with leaves growing on them.  Their trunks are usually protected by a thick layer of bark.  Under the ground, they are supported by roots that draw up moisture and nutrients from the soil.

Silly Bob demonstrates how trees produce oxygen by carrying out a brilliant experiment that you can do at home.  

Silly Bob explains that Scientists have run experiments that show that the overall temperature of the planet is closely related to how much carbon is in the atmosphere.  He explains that, unfortunately, because trees are so useful, they can be chopped down for their wood or sometimes they’re cleared away so that the land can be used for other purposes.  In some parts of the world, trees are vulnerable to forest fires.  
 
The Professor has heard about the Team Trees initiative known as #teamtrees - a group of people trying to raise money to plant 20 million trees and send a message to governments that we care about the planet and want to do protect it.  

Silly Bob tells Flo about where trees come from and he plants an apple tree seed himself.

The Teddy-bear Cholla (Cylindropuntia bigelovii) often forms fairly thick stands that are known locally as ""Cholla Forests."" 

While not exactly a true tree per se, the cholla does have a woody trunk. When living or recently dead, this trunk is very strong - just like the trunk of a pine or maple tree, you'd need a saw to cut it. But after several years of intense weathering under the heat and light of the desert, these trunks become brittle and fragile. I hope you enjoyed learning more about these amazing plants!

What is ROBLOX? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 8 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet­to­be­dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“ROBUX”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.

Medical memes or Doctor Memes are a great way to get a laugh whether or not you are part of the medical community. I think that they are incredibly relatable as you can catch the humor even as a patient. I will say that some of the memes can be mean and if taken out of context can even seem rude BUT we need to understand that this is medical satire. Being able to laugh at ourselves and our troubles is a healthy habit to practice. 

I really enjoy reacting to these memes and I know that there are millions more out there that are as funny. Please if you enjoy this series let me know by liking, commenting, and sharing this video with your friends/family. If I see that you enjoyed it I will put out another post on my IG to send me the best doctor memes and nursing memes so that we can all share a laugh. #DoctorMikeMedicalMemeReview

As they say, laughter is the best medicine, so let's laugh away together! 

If you have an idea of something you want me to cover in-depth, please let me know because I take your requests seriously. We will be back with more Medical Drama Review/Responding to comments Series in a couple of weeks so please submit more names of shows/questions you'd like for me to watch/answer. Love you all!

1rBFpEYRhDw,3 Facts About How Trees Affect Space Travel #TeamTrees,115.0,2019-10-25T19:00:00.000Z,28,Science & Technology,en,none,"DONATE HERE! http://teamtrees.org

Some facts about #TeamTrees I think you will find useful.

Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.

Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

How did #TeamTrees get started?

#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?

We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as being the best. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?

Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

Is this donation tax-deductible?

Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.

What does my donation actually go towards?  

For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!

Where are the trees are being planted? 

Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be state and national forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica! Click here to see a list of the Arbor Day Foundation’s previous work around the globe. 

Who will plant the trees?

The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?

Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?

The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.

Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?

It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focused on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 

I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?

No. And we will never sell your data. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation. 

How do I make my donation with Apple Pay?

Apple Pay payments can only be processed through the Safari browser. To use Apple Pay, open Safari on your desktop or mobile browser and select the Apple Pay logo at the top of the Donate widget.

How do I get in touch with #TeamTrees?

Trees are everything. And maybe we don’t appreciate their beauty or their importance enough, but today we spark change so that our future can be stronger.  

Trees have always given me invaluable experiences. Aside from being our most valuable source of clean air, they have inspired fun, gave me great sense of joy, while always grounding me to Mother Nature. You can be a part of this change and help plant 20M trees for our planet!

On the evening of December 12th, 1985, a two year-old girl mysteriously wandered into a Kmart in Spanway, Washington, all by herself. Store employees desperately tried to find the girl’s parents, but they weren’t anywhere to be seen. The child was too young to be of any help, and with no other viable options, the employees sent the girl to a foster home until police could investigate the case.

Three days later, when her foster mother noticed scratches and bruises on her body, she was taken to Mary Bridge Children’s Medical Center. It was there that a nurse recognized the little girl, Crystal Louise Robertson, as a missing child whose photo had been shown on an earlier news broadcast. When police officers arrived to ask about the whereabouts of her parents, Diane and Michael, all little Crystal could say was: “Mommy is in the trees...”","""cold case"",""unsolved"",""mystery"",""mysterious girl"",""unsolved mystery"",""true crime"",""disappearance"",""mysterious"",""documentary"",""cold-case"",""unsolved mysteries"",""forensic files"",""trees"",""teamtrees"",""#teamtrees"",""scary videos"",""documentaries"",""crime documentary"",""cold case files"",""true crime podcast"",""nonfiction"",""strange clues""",720,201707,7849,185,https://www.youtube.com/embed/W5u2HCxsxjM?autoplay=0,Dark5,2290000,celebrity,201707,720,2966.279411764706,10.588235294117647,0.15365085964363814,3.7995518273940547,spread_word,Connection_comment,2.3333333333333335,2.3333333333333335,1.6666666666666667,n,n,y,n,n,1

Trees have obvious benefits for the worlds, but they also have many secret benefits too. This is a collaboration set out by MrBeast and Mark Rober to try and plant 20,000,000 trees before the 2019 year ends. Trees and not just plants can create an environment for you to prosper and enjoy life more. Please donate to the Arbor Day Foundation, for every dollar donated, is one tree planted.

This horribly sung song is in response to Lil Dicky's Earth music video

LYRICS (something like this): 

Chorus: 
Fuck planet earth
We’re all gonna die
Who cares about the next-gen 
NOT I

Fuck planet earth
We’re all gonna die
Who cares about the next-gen ￼
NOT I 

Verse #1

Screw, happiness, peace, and love 
Let’s go have some fun 
hair spray and lighter fluid 
We can  burn the rain forests up

Let's go all out 
like a drunk girl 
After a bad break up 
& Make mother nature our cuck

throw out the 3 r’s
use more 
more than once
Don’t recycle
Do your part Slash a Tesla Tire
Oprah & Ellen Give everyone a hummer 
We need our co2 
Emissions to be higher 
Then me & snoop dog (yeah)
Until the ozone layer makes like my dad oh so gone 

Chorus: 
Fuck planet earth
We’re all gonna die
Who cares about the next-gen ￼
not I

Fuck planet earth
We’re all gonna die
Who cares about the next-gen anyway￼
not I

Verse #2: 
mother nature’s heart 
Boutta skip a beat
Everyone lighting a lighter 
ice caps melting faster
Throw trash in the street
no wait, no, not beneath our feet
Out into the sea
Fuck the sea creatures
They’re only good for an expensive
Entrees on a first date with a gold digger you don’t even need 
Cause you have your right-hand man
You know what I mean dam

Bridge: 
Look at what we’ve done
The whole worlds on fire
The climate has changed
California has snow
Chicago isn’t cold
Most of everything is underwater
or all burned up 
At least we’re safe 
Drifting space

But I feel a burning in my gut
I'm homesick 
For the trees and the sea
Too bad we let it leave


Chorus: 
Fuck planet earth
We’re all gonna die
Who cares about the next-gen anyway￼
Not I

Fuck planet earth
We’re all gonna die
Who cares about the next-gen anyway￼
Not I

""New research estimates that a worldwide planting program could remove two-thirds of all the emissions from human activities that remain in the atmosphere today, a figure the scientists describe as “mind-blowing”

""His new quantitative evaluation shows [forest] restoration isn’t just one of our climate change solutions, it is overwhelmingly the top one""

""It is available now, it is the cheapest one possible and every one of us can get involved""

""Trees provide the very necessities of life itself. They clean our air, protect our drinking water, create healthy communities, and feed the human soul. But these life necessities are threatened around the globe. To address this, we’re launching an unprecedented undertaking: the Time for Trees initiative. Together, we can create change … through trees.""

How do trees get so tall? Do you know? Trees sprout from seeds, just like flowers, but then they grow MUCH MUCH taller. In this video, we’ll talk about HOW trees do it! They don’t grow bigger all over, like you do. They only grow in very special areas. We’ll learn about a special kind of tissue in trees called MERISTEM. We’ll also play a game - can you guess the tree, if you see its seed? Watch and find out! 

Socratica Kids is proud to be part of #TeamTrees!  #TeamTrees is a collaboration of your favourite YouTubers who are working together to plant 20 MILLION trees by January 1st, 2020.  We’re raising funds with the help of the Arbor Day Foundation, who are known around the world for planting and supporting beautiful trees. 

If you want to join #TeamTrees, visit teamtrees.org.  Be sure to get the help of your grownup.  
The goal is to raise $20 million dollars by 1/1/2020. That comes out to $1 per tree. What a bargain! 
The Arbor Day Foundation is working hard to find where in the world are the best places to plant these 20 million trees - where are they needed and where will they grow well. That way the trees can grow strong and healthy, and can contribute to a healthier planet for all of us! 

We have a related video all about Arbor Day:

Mr Beast, Mark Rober and over 500 YouTube Creators are embarking on a mission to plant 20,000,000 trees by the start of 2020.

TeamTrees FAQ:
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

How did #TeamTrees get started?
#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as having the best reputation. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

Is this donation tax-deductible?
Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.

What does my donation actually go towards?  
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!

Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be State and National Forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.
Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focussed on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 

I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?
No. And we will never sell your data, etc. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation.

There are 2 types of breathing: chest breathing, and abdominal (or diaphragmatic) breathing. Chest breathing is meant to be used in times of great exertion, like a sprint or an emergency situation. It uses the secondary muscles in our chest to pull our chest (and usually shoulders) upward and outward. Other than during exercise, we may find ourselves using chest breathing when we are stressed out. That’s why many of us hold our stress in our neck and shoulders.

Hello and welcome! My name is Anton and in this video, we will talk about a new incredible discovery that plants (tobacco, tomato and cactus at least) scream producing loud high pitched noises when under stress!

The Crew was called upon to join the Team Trees movement, so they immediately got to work devising a plan on how to spread the word! A few days later, they met in the woods to discuss some of the best tree puns they could find, but it seems Juztyn didn't bring his A-game. Now after being left behind by Pags and Joe, Juztyn must find his way back, and redeem himself by finding the most powerful tree pun of all!

FAQ:
How did #TeamTrees get started?
It started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as being the best. They are one of the largest and longest-running tree planting NGOs, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org, the YouTube donate button, Arbor Day’s #TeamTrees Facebook fundraiser, or the #TeamTrees fundraiser are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

What does my donation go towards?
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. 

Where are the trees being planted?
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted, they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be public forestlands managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica! Click here (https://shop.arborday.org/donate-fire.aspx?TrackingID=619) to see a list of the Arbor Day Foundation’s previous work around the globe.

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners such as the U.S. Forest Service, and other government and nongovernmental agencies, to ensure that tree-planting best practices are followed.

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

Can planting trees solve climate change?
No, not on its own. Trees are a proven natural climate solution but we need to adhere to the science and attack the problem from many angles at once. #TeamTrees is planting 20 million trees in order to 1) be part of the solution, 2) send a strong signal that this massive community cares about the planet we all call home, and 3) Planting trees is a simple solution that everyone can get behind.

This is great! How can I get involved with Team Trees?
Apart from donating, there are a number of ways to help. The best way to support our goal is to tell other people about it — we want everyone to plant trees! Make something creative to spread the word like art, a song, or a video. Don’t forget to include a call-to-action (hint… plant trees), include #TeamTrees, our deadline (January 1st, 2020), and teamtrees.org.
Help make this as big as possible. 

When you see #TeamTrees videos or live streams or social media content out in the world, do all of us a favor and like/ReTweet/share/comment. Be generous with your attention and help get the message out.

*Please Read*
Base Links will always work as long as they have been used (clicked) within a 28 day period. If a Base Link hasn’t been used for over 28 days it will expire and no longer work. Unfortunately this means you’ll have to manually copy the base. Please let me know if any links do stop working and I'll try and get you a new one.

The bases that I review come from a variety of sources: Websites, Facebook, Clan Mates and Subscribers. It can often be difficult to establish when a base was originally designed and by who…this is the awesome nature of base designs as they’re always being modified by everyone! I’ll always try my best to identify the original base designer and give them a big shout out but this isn't always possible. Although most bases are tested in the Legend League the majority can be used as either a Legend League or War Base.

There’s a lot of test gear out there – each piece of gear comes with its own set of capabilities, form factors, and complexities. There’s so much variance out there that it’s hard to sort out what’s what, even for someone like me who spends all day every day working with it.
But, it doesn’t have to be that complicated. Today we’re going to look at a method that I believe will give you a framework for grasping every single piece of test gear out there – a “test gear family tree” if you will. Is that to good to be true?
Today we’re going to through a method that will let you classify every single piece of test gear out there, which will give you a good baseline to start from next time you find yourself in front of an instrument you’ve never used before. I also asked folks on the EEVBlog forum to stump me with the weirdest test gear they’ve come across to see if the system can be broken – at the end of this video we’ll look at those and see if this system holds up.
This video is also part of the team trees YouTuber initiative to plant 20 million trees by 2020 – every $1 donated at teamtrees.org plants a tree in collaboration with the Arbor Day Foundation, so check that link out in the description as well!
Finally, we’re toying with the idea of a scope giveaway at 100k subscribers, so hit like if you think that’s a good idea and get subscribed if you aren’t already!
All right, let’s get started. Every piece of test gear falls into one of two categories, they are either an input-based device, meaning they take in information and do something with it, or an output-based device, meaning they take a user input and source out something.  – and yes there are blends, but we’ll get to that later.
These input and output devices also come in two flavors
The first flavor is time-domain test gear – which, as you can probably guess, functions with respect to time, they usually work with parametric systems – like a DMM or function generator, or they work digital signals, for example a protocol analyzer.
The other flavor is frequency domain test gear, often thought of as RF and microwave test gear – and these typically work with data communicated in specific frequency bands instead of bits changing over time. So, they typically give measurements or source signals that are focused in and around a frequency band.
So, test gear is either input-based or output-based, and functions mainly in the time domain, or mainly in the frequency domain. Let’s dig in deeper, and explore test gear that is based on inputs.
Input based test gear is used to get data. It takes something from the world around us, typically voltage or current, but sometimes things like temperature, pressure, or luminosity – and turns it into information we, the users, can use.
From a spec standpoint, there’s really only two things that matter for input-focused test gear: the quantity of inputs, and the quality of inputs. Quantity is pretty straightforward – how many channels or ports does it have? but quality is trickier. The different flavors of test gear all have a different take on what input quality means, but typically the most important specs are related to noise floor, accuracy, and resolution. And, how good these specs are is dependent on the specific architecture and design of that instrument. Interestingly enough, input based test gear is all built around same basic architecture. I’m also going to leave out vintage gear and focus on modern, non-CRT gear, because those are a whole different ballgame.
Just like input-based gear, the two big specs are signal quality and quantity, but output-based devices also have a huge range of signal types they can spit out, from generic sine waves to complex test patterns. Almost without fail, there are two main ways these get used by RF engineers. The first is to test expected behavior of a device. Basically, you take an ideal signal, or a golden signal, from your test gear and hook it up to your device, and then characterize and test your device under ideal conditions. Then, you try to break it. You mix up your golden signal and turn it into a terrible signal to see if your device can handle it, or to make sure your failure modes kick in properly.

Being a tree ain’t easy.  Dogs pee on them. People cut them down for raw materials to make everything from toilet paper to million dollar homes, and those that dare to defend them are called “tree huggers”—a moniker that makes it difficult for most people to take their cause seriously.  But the simple truth is that we should all do what can to promote tree conservation, because every animal on the planet depends on them. In this episode of Animal Facts, we’ll focus on the relationship between animals and trees, a mutually beneficial relationship that is vital to the life cycles of both.

 #teamtrees  #arborday

sBaG_xBQbzo,Real Reason Why Home Builders Destroy So Many Trees 🌲#TeamTrees,516.0,2019-10-31T13:56:23.000Z,27,Education,en,none,"Why Home Builders Destroy So Many Trees 🌲
Homebuilders across the country destroy trees to put up new neighborhoods. Around Louisiana, you’ll see a new neighborhood going up and the home builder has a huge pile of trees laying in the back of the property that will ultimately be set on fire and never be used for any other purpose. There is a good reason most home builders destroy so many trees. We are going to look into options you can make for yourself to replace the trees that were lost during the construction of your new home. Most people are afraid to plant trees around their homes due to the fact of the root system damaging the foundation of the home but trees add value to your home! I’ll show you some safer trees to plant for that issue and explain how much your home's value will go up by adding trees. If you have no plans to plant any trees around your home You can also donate to #teamtrees here is the website https://www.teamtrees.org/ for every dollar given 1 🌲tree🌲 will be planted.

2 years on Youtube and 10k subscribers! Thank you all so much for the support on this journey so far, this stream is for you. You can read more about the Rags to Riches Charity Stream Challenge on The Division 2 here if you want to know the details: https://gcrock.com/rags-to-riches-24-hour-charity-stream-challenge

As we all know, us humans are destroying this planet on a grand scale. One of the biggest problems among many other big problems, is that we love to cut down our trees and use them for our own benefit. The irony is that fully stood up living trees are far more benefiical to us than that which we cut them down for. If it wasn't for trees there would be no humans and possibly no life at all.

In our Rags to Riches 24-hour stream challenge on The Division 2, we aim to equal our charity stream record and raise £1000 to plant 1000 trees (With conversion rate it will be more trees). Currently they have raised $15.9 million and I would love for our community to help and add to that figure. The goal is £1000 but anything raised is going to a great cause and if we can do more then great!

There are many tree planting initiatives like The Nature Conservancy in Australia which aims to plant 1Billion trees by 2030 and Cauvery calling which has the aim of planting 2.42Billion trees and are already up to 44million.
So, even thought I'm a small youtuber.. I couldn't help myself getting on board too.
$1 will see TeamTrees in conjunction with the Arbor Socity, plant 1 tree. $5/5 trees and so on. Click the link, help Mr Beast, help the planet.

We're joining the #teamtrees group collab to talk about why trees are so important to birds.  Please subscribe to continue learning what makes life AWESOME: https://BioBush.tv/subscribe

To make a donation: https://teamtrees.org.
Every $1 donated will turn into a tree planted somewhere in the world, on public or private land, by the Arbor Day Foundation.  All donations go directly to this charity and are tax-deductible.  Every little bit helps, and I will be making a donation as well!

Birds use almost every part of trees!  We go from trunk to flowers to find all the different useful things trees do for birds.

The trunk harbors insects for some species to eat, and many birds nest in tree hollows.

The branches are great for shelter, but also for building nests.  And some very trusting birds lay eggs directly on branches.

Leaves provide shade and shelter from the elements, and we show how good some birds are at camouflaging in leaves.

And the delicious part of the relationship, birds eat flowers, fruit, and seeds from trees.  In fact, for many tree species that's why fruit and seeds exist!

I hope you learned something new about trees and why they are so important.  Again, please consider making a donation on https://teamtrees.org.

I started making political, religious and social commentary on YouTube early 2013 on a different channel. I have always had an interest in philosophy but I never pursued it at university. Instead, I completed a bachelors of social science late 2016 focusing on psychology and criminology just before I gained partner on Twitch.tv. While my focus is on streaming and speedrunning these days, I still answer questions from viewers in chat and talk about any topics that come to mind. I don’t shy away from many topics and will be open and honest about what I believe, why I believe and to what level of confidence I can hold my beliefs on any particular issue (belief meaning something I accept as likely true). I have been referred to as a ‘scuffed Destiny’ but honestly I think we differ significantly. I ask you to take these videos to be what they are, rambles. They are not meant to be video essays describing every minute detail of a topic, that is beyond my ability while I am speedrunning. I can not be as eloquent or substantive while gaming but I do try my best.

This is not usually my type of content but I got infected with the #Teamtrees virus and I want to make a difference.
You know that saying: every man should plant a tree? or something like that....
Well, I decided to do it literally... not just one, but 25 pine trees.

TeamTrees FAQ:
Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

How did #TeamTrees get started?
#TeamTrees started in May 2019 when the internet challenged MrBeast to plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20M subscriber milestone. Fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other YouTubers and influencers to make it happen. A growing group of them have been working hard for the past five months to set up the framework for this insane goal to have a fighting chance of success.

Who exactly is the Arbor Day Foundation and why did you choose them over other tree planting NGOs?
We quickly realized that to plant trees in a sustainable and environmentally friendly way we would need to partner with the professionals. After speaking with a number of people in the environmental space, the Arbor Day Foundation stood out as having the best reputation. They are the longest-running tree planting NGO, with 47 years of experience, and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American Red Cross.  

Does my donation go directly to the Arbor Day Foundation?
Yes. Donations through either TeamTrees.org or the YouTube donate button are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree-planting. One dollar plants one tree.

Is this donation tax-deductible?
Since the Arbor Day Foundation is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit charitable organization, there’s a good chance your monetary donation is tax deductible, but we recommend that you consult your tax professional, who’s familiar with your specific tax situation, to be sure.  The Foundation’s Federal Tax ID number (also known as an EIN, Employer Identification Number) is 23-7169265.

What does my donation actually go towards?  
For every dollar you donate, one tree will be planted in a forest of high need around the globe. It's that simple!

Where are the trees are being planted? 
Due to the sheer volume of trees planted (20 million), they will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need. Many of these forests will be State and National Forests managed by government agencies. The goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica!

Who will plant the trees?
The Arbor Day Foundation works closely with professional forestry partners including the U.S. Forest Service, and other government agencies and NGOs. They collect donations and send the funds to their reforestation partners, enabling them to cover the costs required to plant the trees. 

When will the trees be planted?
Trees will be planted throughout the year starting in January of 2020 and completed no later than December 2022. 

What species are going to be planted?
The Arbor Day Foundation always emphasizes planting native species where local conditions and forest plans allow. Their motto is to plant the right trees, in the right place, for the right reasons.
Why are you planting trees instead of preserving ones that already exist?
It is vitally important to protect, manage, and restore forests globally. We are focussed on restoration because, according to the National Academy of Sciences, forest restoration has the most global climate mitigation potential compared to all other natural climate solutions. Restoring lands through tree planting is the Arbor Day Foundation’s area of expertise and something they’ve been doing for nearly five decades. There’s no silver bullet for fixing climate change, just silver buckshot, so we should actively pursue many different approaches including both preservation and restoration. 

I’m not signing up for junk mail am I?
No. And we will never sell your data, etc. Many people are requesting updates on our progress, so we will send those (sparingly) if you tell us you want them when you make your donation. 


How do I get in touch with #TeamTrees?
If you have questions about your donation, contact donations@teamtrees.org. For media inquiries, contact press@teamtrees.org. For everything else, email info@teamtrees.org.
